- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ela.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m pretty new but massivly interested in AI themes in general and machine learning in particular.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently planing to build a simulation map for the website of my bookprojekt. It should change the environment randomly by pressing a button.
- Ah, yes, and I'm not a developer but pretty much an interested older lady and a non native speaker. So be a bit patient.
